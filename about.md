Hi, My Name is Chris Oâ€™Donnell and this is my personal blog site.  I am a web developer; my background includes game design and the startup community. I have a love for design and creativity. Here I will be covering topics that interest me, Web Development, Game Design, Music and History... 
 
During the production of Monolith, my greyscale adventure puzzle game done with the Unreal 3 engine, I discoverd a love for computer prgraming. So after the failure of the [kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/327286485/project-monolith) I decided to explore my options. Taking advice from a friend I picked up ruby which lead me to rails and web development. 

I enjoy learning and like to get to the heart of the issue,  I am constantly trying to improve myself and my abilities as well as offer advice to those met along the way. Everything is a work in progress, wip.
