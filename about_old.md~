 Hi, this My Name is Chris Oâ€™Donnell and this is my personal blog site. I have a love for design and creativity. I am a web developer; my background includes game design and the startup community.  I will be covering topics that interest me.

After the failure of my kickstarter campaign(https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/327286485/project-monolith), I had realized that I enjoyed computer programing and decided to explore my options. Taking advice from a friend I picked up ruby which lead me to rails and web development. I enjoy learning and like to get to the heart of the issue,   I am constantly trying to improve myself and my abilities as well as offer advice to those meet along the way.  Everything is a work in progress, wip.
