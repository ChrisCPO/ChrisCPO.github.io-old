* topics :pair programming, :life lesson

It seems like most programmers have a discomfort when it comes to pair programing. When our Thoughtbot instructors first introduced the concept to us, I had that same reaction as well. How can I learn if I have to work with another person and share the same computer? At first, it’s kind of weird and awkward like most new friendships, as you quickly figure out each other’s quirks, mannerisms, and workstyle. But that’s the point: to push each person out of one’s comfort zone and stretch them as they work through a problem together.
 
What about actually working together? Who drives? It’s not a pilot and co-pilot relationship; it’s a pilot and a navigator. What are these roles?  The pilot is the person typing the code. The navigator is directing the pilot, doing research on the problem, and looking up solutions. Simple enough. While the navigator is looking things up, the pilot can be experimenting with the code, adjusting things to see if the problem can be solved with the information at hand. They can also do research together for bigger problems.
 
Now who should be in the pilot role? I think it depends on what the problem is, who is the more experienced programmer, and the learning style of the programmers. Basically it’s mostly situational. Here are my general guidelines, so far. Do both programmers know the code base? Maybe. Maybe not. I would let the person who knows the code base drive; they know their way around the file structure. Plus, the navigator can offer a fresh perspective. If the junior programmer is a kinetic learner, then let them drive. Some people need to learn by doing under direction. If the junior programmer is a visual learner, then maybe they should navigate. However, they might know exactly what to look up and be the best navigator. I think the best role to play for the junior developer would be the pilot.
 
When starting a new project with someone, I would almost always suggest pair programming, especially if you have never worked with them before. This allows both programmers to get inside of each other’s minds, work styles, and habits, as well as be on the same page with the code and one another.
 
The biblical proverb “As iron sharpens iron, one man sharpens another” is true, especially in pair programming.
