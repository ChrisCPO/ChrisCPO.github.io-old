Hi, this My Name is Chris Oâ€™Donnell and this is my personal blog site. I have a love for design and creativity. I am a web developer; my background includes game design and the startup community.  Here I will be covering topics that interest me, Web Development, Game Design, Music and History. 
 
During the production of Monolith, my greyscale advnture puzzle game done with the Unreal 3 engine, I discoverd a love for computer prgraming. So after the failure of the [kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/327286485/project-monolith) I decided to explore my options. Taking advice from a friend I picked up ruby which lead me to rails and web development. 

I enjoy learning and like to get to the heart of the issue,   I am constantly trying to improve myself and my abilities as well as offer advice to those meet along the way.  Everything is a work in progress, wip.
